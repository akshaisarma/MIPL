\section{Introduction}

Introduction here.

Item sample.
\begin{itemize}
\item item1 To the best of our knowledge, the MMSN protocol is the first
\item item2 Instead of using pairwise RTS/CTS frequency negotiation

% Head 1
\section{Lexical conventions}
MIPL has six kinds of tokens: identifiers, variables, numbers, strings,
expression operators, and other separators.  In general blanks, tabs,
newlines, and comments as described below are ignored except as they
serve to separate tokens. At least one of these characters is required
to separate otherwise adjacent identifiers, constants, and certain
operatorpairs.  If the input stream has been parsed into tokens up
to a given character, the next token is taken to include the longest
string of characters which could possibly constitute a token.

% Head 2
\subsection{Comments}

MIPL uses shell script-like comments, which begins with the character
\# and terminates at the end of the line, separated by the newline character.

% Head 3
\subsection{Identifiers}

An identifier is a sequence of letters that begins with lower case alphabets.
Upper and lower case letters are considered different.   Identifiers are
served for use as the name of Terms, the basic block of MIPL syntax.

\subsection{Variables}

A variable is a sequence of letters that begins with upper case alphabets
or the underscore character, \_, which means that this variable will not
be tracked.  Upper and lower case letters in the variable names are
considered different. 

\subsection{Numbers}

A number in MIPL is a floating number.  A number consists of an integer
part, a decimal point, a fraction part, an e, and an optionally signed integer
exponent. The integer and fraction parts both consist of a sequence of digits.
Either the integer part or the fraction
part (not both) may be missing; either the decimal point or the
e and the exponent (not both) may be missing.
Every floating constant is taken to be doubleprecision.

\subsection{Strings}

A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes or single
quotes.
A string has the type arrayofcharacters
(see below) and refers to an area of storage initialized with the given
characters. The compiler places a null byte ( \\0 ) at the end of each
string so that programs which scan the string can find its end. In a
string, the character ..  " ..  must be preceded by a ..\.. ; in
addition, the same escapes as described for character constants may be used.
