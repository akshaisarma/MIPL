# Description: A MIPL program that shows how to
#              define and use jobs
#              In this example, no large data sets
#              are ever loaded acutally at client's side.
#              It transfers the file to the clusters
#              and maintains the file's location,
#              while requesting computations to the clusters.
#              At last query, a single number is actually
#              copied to the client from the clusters.

addJob(A, B) {
 @A + B.

 @A * B.
}

 @rowsum(A).
}

[a] <- load("very_large.dat").

[s] <- addJob(a, load("very_large2.dat")).

[m] <- multJob(a, s).

[r] <- rowsumJob(m).
